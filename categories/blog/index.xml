      <description>Getting started When you first open up a submitted web page, you may be wondering what is different between the submission and the live versions. During user training, encourage your content managers to write descriptions that outline what they&amp;rsquo;ve changed.
Encourage content managers to write a clear subject and message detailing what content has changed.  Before you begin reviewing, save a new version of the staged page with a description &amp;ldquo;As submitted by user,&amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;this way, you can revert or compare your changes to the original submission.</description>

      <description>By Heidi King, OmniUpdate Guest Post 
It’s no secret that Google is the world’s largest search engine, but few people realize that YouTube is in second place. Consider these statistics:
 About 1.3 billion people use the platform.
 YouTube is bigger than Bing, Yahoo!, Ask, and AOL combined.
 The site gets over 30 million visitors daily.
 YouTube on mobile reaches more 18–49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.</description>

      <title>OU Campus Components vs. Snippets</title>
      <link>https://www.satinflame.com/blog/2019/07/oucampus-components-vs-snippets/</link>

      <description>For years, managing advanced features within OU Campus has been handled using a variety of snippets and assets. As a reminder, snippets come in two versions: 1) an inserted chunk of code or text that will be manually edited and managed and 2) table-transformations, which will be the majority of the examples for this article. Assets, similarly, can be used to manage a chunk of code, text, form, or collection of photos within a page; however, since each asset is centrally updated, every instance of one asset points to one source.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Access to your Google Analytics Account</title>

      <description>If your site has a mysterious secondary Google Analytics number added to your website&amp;rsquo;s source code or you can&amp;rsquo;t find anyone at your school who seems to know the information for your Google Analytics setup, you may think that the existing information is now lost forever. However, there is one last measure you can try before giving up hope and creating a new Google Analytics account. First, be sure you can login to Google Analytics with the email you choose before requesting your email be added to the account in the following steps.</description>

      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>

      <description>My previous history included years of working as a front-end developer in higher education. It was hard to know what I&amp;rsquo;d get out of a 12-week bootcamp, but with a large amount of experience and self-study under my belt, I was ready to commit to finally getting the full exposure of modern web development. With 11 weeks behind me and only one week left, I wanted to share the journey so far.</description>

      <title>Setting Up A Multi Website Magento Store</title>

      <description>Last year I had the opportunity to learn about working in the e-commerce platform Magento–creating products, adding modules, updating security patches and more. Though there is a lot to learn, understanding the file structure of Magento was essential in order to migrate another store (running version 1.4) into a multi-website for another store that had been recently upgraded to 1.9.2. While searching for the best process, I learned there are many ways to set up a second store on the same Magento install—but there were many things I still didn’t understand being the novice server administer of a one-person web team.</description>

      <description>While this entry could also be aptly named OMG How Do I Make Pages Load Faster in Magento?, I’ve finally found a solution to speeding up my Magento website that makes me so much less bitter, I can now even think semi-straight. If you’re searching for answers as well–and perhaps not finding adequate solutions–I hope this post will be of value for learning all the different ways to increase your Magento website’s performance!</description>

      <title>Giant Decline in Bounce Rate: Is it Really a Good Thing?</title>

      <description>Is it Really a Good Thing?
No, probably not.
In April 2016, I updated a website with a fresh, responsive Magento design in collaboration with Social Ruckus in Bozeman, Montana. There was a noticeable slowing of the websites as most features used AJAX and dynamic loading. Even so, I noticed a huge drop (~50% to 3%) in bounce rate. Bounce dropped after releasing RWD&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nervous. What other metrics should I look at?</description>

      <description>Although there are many resources to choose from within Amazon’s Vendor Central Resource Center, the following actions are some simple ways to improve the findability of your products:
Create variation families If you have many items with similar features, be sure your customer can see them all immediately. By using Amazon’s variation form, you can associate your products with one another using up to two variation options. The most common variants include color, style and size.</description>
