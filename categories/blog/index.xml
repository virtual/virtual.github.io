      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>

      <description>My previous history included years of working as a front-end developer in higher education. It was hard to know what I&amp;rsquo;d get out of a 12-week bootcamp, but with a large amount of experience and self-study under my belt, I was ready to commit to finally getting the full exposure of modern web development. With 11 weeks behind me and only one week left, I wanted to share the journey so far.</description>

      <description>Last year I had the opportunity to learn about working in the e-commerce platform Magento–creating products, adding modules, updating security patches and more. Though there is a lot to learn, understanding the file structure of Magento was essential in order to migrate another store (running version 1.4) into a multi-website for another store that had been recently upgraded to 1.9.2. While searching for the best process, I learned there are many ways to set up a second store on the same Magento install—but there were many things I still didn’t understand being the novice server administer of a one-person web team.</description>

      <description>While this entry could also be aptly named OMG How Do I Make Pages Load Faster in Magento?, I’ve finally found a solution to speeding up my Magento website that makes me so much less bitter, I can now even think semi-straight. If you’re searching for answers as well–and perhaps not finding adequate solutions–I hope this post will be of value for learning all the different ways to increase your Magento website’s performance!</description>

      <description>Is it Really a Good Thing?
No, probably not.
In April 2016, I updated a website with a fresh, responsive Magento design in collaboration with Social Ruckus in Bozeman, Montana. There was a noticeable slowing of the websites as most features used AJAX and dynamic loading. Even so, I noticed a huge drop (~50% to 3%) in bounce rate. Bounce dropped after releasing RWD&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nervous. What other metrics should I look at?</description>

      <description>Regardless if you’ve been handed an inventory of products you know nothing about, or if you’ve been maintaining your catalog for years, there may be a few things you haven’t considered when managing your products.
Although there are many resources to choose from within Amazon’s Vendor Central Resource Center, the following actions are some simple ways to improve the findability of your products:
Create variation families If you have many items with similar features, be sure your customer can see them all immediately.</description>
