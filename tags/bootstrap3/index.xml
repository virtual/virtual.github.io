      <description>In 2015, I had the pleasure of implementing a university lead generation form designed by Graphic Designer Ron Lambert and the Montana State University marketing team!
Overall this design was challenging due to a few of our special page requirements:
Keep the users on the lead page In order to get the contact information we hoped for, we had to include enough content to remain informative without linking to other pages.</description>

      <description>When looking into how best to create an image with interactive elements, I had to go beyond using outdated image maps and get creative with implementing maps using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and creating a responsive, interactive information pop-ups!
This map looks great on desktop and mobile**—**test it out yourself! The functionality enables a user to click either the name or the building itself to learn more about it.
Within Illustrator, we grouped paths and then was able to edit the exported .</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>
