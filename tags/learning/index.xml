      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>
