      <title>Using Image Sets to Create Responsive Images in OU Campus</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret: these past years have seen ever-increasing sizes of images to feature on your school&amp;rsquo;s homepage. Though some designs are now implementing smaller images (and thankfully taking a step back from large carousels), these pages can still pack a punch to your visitors&#39; bandwidth. With over 30% of users likely visiting from mobile devices, it would be ideal that a 480px-wide mobile device only downloads a 480px-wide image instead of the 1200px-wide image that is typically designed for a desktop monitor.</description>

It’s no secret that Google is the world’s largest search engine, but few people realize that YouTube is in second place. Consider these statistics:
  About 1.3 billion people use the platform.
  YouTube is bigger than Bing, Yahoo!, Ask, and AOL combined.
  The site gets over 30 million visitors daily.
  YouTube on mobile reaches more 18–49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.</description>

      <title>OU Campus Components vs. Snippets</title>

      <description>For years, managing advanced features within OU Campus has been handled using a variety of snippets and assets. As a reminder, snippets come in two versions: 1) an inserted chunk of code or text that will be manually edited and managed and 2) table-transformations, which will be the majority of the examples for this article. Assets, similarly, can be used to manage a chunk of code, text, form, or collection of photos within a page; however, since each asset is centrally updated, every instance of one asset points to one source.</description>

      <title>Shoreline Community College Redesign</title>

      <description>In January 2018, Shoreline unveiled an updated Identity Guideline which I implemented from the original PDF into an interactive Identity Guidelines webpage. (As an reminder, it is a best practice—as noted by Jakob Nielsen—to use HTML instead of PDF for online presentations.) In addition to structuring the content to be responsive regardless of device, I added hex codes to each color block and made them clickable so a user could easily copy the color codes to their clipboard.</description>

      <description>In 2015, I had the pleasure of implementing a university lead generation form designed by Graphic Designer Ron Lambert and the Montana State University marketing team!
Overall this design was challenging due to a few of our special page requirements:
Keep the users on the lead page In order to get the contact information we hoped for, we had to include enough content to remain informative without linking to other pages.</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>

      <description>ECSU Secondary Page    ECSU Homepage    ECSU Admissions    ECSU History Page   In 2015, I worked with Vayakone Sphabmixay from the Sax Agency implementing their redesign for Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. There were many creative design pieces that presented fun challenges for implementing in a responsive environment.

      <description>In the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to develop the code for a design created by the team at I-SITE, INC. for the College of Professional Students in Boston, MA. Unlike new development work, this redesign required an update to the base code using only minimal CSS.
Before updating, this Web page had used mobile queries to (unfortunately) simply hide the “unnecessary” mobile elements to make the content disappear on smaller devices.</description>
