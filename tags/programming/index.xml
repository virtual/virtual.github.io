      <description>In January 2018, Shoreline unveiled an updated Identity Guideline which I implemented from the original PDF into an interactive Identity Guidelines webpage. In addition to structuring the content to be responsive regardless of device, I added hex codes to each color block and made them clickable so a user could easily copy the color codes to their clipboard. An interesting challenge developed in implementing similar functionality for the Outlook signature block.</description>

      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>

      <description>My previous history included years of working as a front-end developer in higher education. It was hard to know what I&amp;rsquo;d get out of a 12-week bootcamp, but with a large amount of experience and self-study under my belt, I was ready to commit to finally getting the full exposure of modern web development. With 11 weeks behind me and only one week left, I wanted to share the journey so far.</description>

      <title>Setting Up A Multi Website Magento Store</title>

      <description>Last year I had the opportunity to learn about working in the e-commerce platform Magento–creating products, adding modules, updating security patches and more. Though there is a lot to learn, understanding the file structure of Magento was essential in order to migrate another store (running version 1.4) into a multi-website for another store that had been recently upgraded to 1.9.2. While searching for the best process, I learned there are many ways to set up a second store on the same Magento install—but there were many things I still didn’t understand being the novice server administer of a one-person web team.</description>

      <description>While this entry could also be aptly named OMG How Do I Make Pages Load Faster in Magento?, I’ve finally found a solution to speeding up my Magento website that makes me so much less bitter, I can now even think semi-straight. If you’re searching for answers as well–and perhaps not finding adequate solutions–I hope this post will be of value for learning all the different ways to increase your Magento website’s performance!</description>

      <description>In 2015, I had the pleasure of implementing a university lead generation form designed by Graphic Designer Ron Lambert and the Montana State University marketing team!
Overall this design was challenging due to a few of our special page requirements:
Keep the users on the lead page In order to get the contact information we hoped for, we had to include enough content to remain informative without linking to other pages.</description>

      <description>When looking into how best to create an image with interactive elements, I had to go beyond using outdated image maps and get creative with implementing maps using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and creating a responsive, interactive information pop-ups!
This map looks great on desktop and mobile—test it out yourself! The functionality enables a user to click either the name or the building itself to learn more about it.
Within Illustrator, we grouped paths and then was able to edit the exported .</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>

In 2015, I worked with Vayakone Sphabmixay from SAX, Inc. implementing their redesign for Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. There were many creative design pieces that presented fun challenges for implementing in a responsive environment.

      <description>In the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to develop the code for a design created by the team at I-SITE, INC. for the College of Professional Students in Boston, MA. Unlike new development work, this redesign required an update to the base code using only minimal CSS.
Before updating, this Web page had used mobile queries to (unfortunately) simply hide the “unnecessary” mobile elements to make the content disappear on smaller devices.</description>
