      <description>Is it Really a Good Thing?
No, probably not.
In April 2016, I updated a website with a fresh, responsive Magento design in collaboration with Social Ruckus in Bozeman, Montana. There was a noticeable slowing of the websites as most features used AJAX and dynamic loading. Even so, I noticed a huge drop (~50% to 3%) in bounce rate. Bounce dropped after releasing RWD&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nervous. What other metrics should I look at?</description>
