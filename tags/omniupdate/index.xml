      <description>In January 2018, Shoreline unveiled an updated Identity Guideline which I implemented from the original PDF into an interactive Identity Guidelines webpage. (As an reminder, it is a best practice—as noted by Jakob Nielsen—to use HTML instead of PDF for online presentations.) In addition to structuring the content to be responsive regardless of device, I added hex codes to each color block and made them clickable so a user could easily copy the color codes to their clipboard.</description>

      <title>Adding Bar Graphs using Highcharts in OU Campus</title>
      <link>https://www.satinflame.com/blog/2018/09/bar-graph-highcharts-ou-campus/</link>

      <description>In this example, the HTML table is transformed using the Highcharts library—it is free for non-profits, so go grab a Highcharts Non-commercial license.
On your page, include the Highcharts library file as well as your customized JS—specific to this type of bar graph setup. In your file at /_resources/ou/editor/wysiwyg.css or similar, add the following CSS to show the table in edit mode only:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  #datatable.</description>

      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>

      <description>Overview This code demo available on GitHub allows you to create a loading progress bar that is managed from a table transformation within OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus. The CSS and JavaScript must be added into your page either by including it into your global files or making a separate call to each. The jQuery library must be loaded prior to calling the JavaScript code. Developers: If you add on any helpful additions, please make a Pull Request!</description>

      <description>Sometimes redesigns need to happen fast! If your web team is small or needs a helping hand in preparing your website ready for its big unveil, consider contacting me for information on how I can help!
For this project, I worked with Missy at Horry Georgetown Technical College to help her quickly release the migration of her new beautiful redesign out into the “wild!”
I contributed in the following ways:</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>

In 2015, I worked with Vayakone Sphabmixay from SAX, Inc. implementing their redesign for Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. There were many creative design pieces that presented fun challenges for implementing in a responsive environment.

      <description>In the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to develop the code for a design created by the team at I-SITE, INC. for the College of Professional Students in Boston, MA. Unlike new development work, this redesign required an update to the base code using only minimal CSS.
Before updating, this Web page had used mobile queries to (unfortunately) simply hide the “unnecessary” mobile elements to make the content disappear on smaller devices.</description>
