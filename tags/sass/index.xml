      <description>In January 2018, Shoreline unveiled an updated Identity Guideline which I implemented from the original PDF into an interactive Identity Guidelines webpage. (As an reminder, it is a best practice—as noted by Jakob Nielsen—to use HTML instead of PDF for online presentations.) In addition to structuring the content to be responsive regardless of device, I added hex codes to each color block and made them clickable so a user could easily copy the color codes to their clipboard.</description>

      <description>In 2015, I had the pleasure of implementing a university lead generation form designed by Graphic Designer Ron Lambert and the Montana State University marketing team!
Overall this design was challenging due to a few of our special page requirements:
Keep the users on the lead page In order to get the contact information we hoped for, we had to include enough content to remain informative without linking to other pages.</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>

      <description>In 2015, I worked with Vayakone Sphabmixay from SAX, Inc. implementing their redesign for Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. There were many creative design pieces that presented fun challenges for implementing in a responsive environment.
Historical Year Timeline The timeline is both collapsible and adapts to mobile devices. In addition, with this and other dynamic pages developed—such as the Past Presidents of ECSU—a page scroll to the updated area was necessary to orient users to new information.</description>
