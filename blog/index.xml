      <description>Making the leap to apply for a new school can be exciting but scary. Often prospective students are looking for answers prior to clicking that magical Apply Now button—but what if they can&amp;rsquo;t find the information they need? Who can they contact?
Creating a system to deliver consistent contact information is an opportunity to help your higher ed website shine and encourage students to reach out! In the following project, we developed a standardized contact region and the tools to manage it using OU Campus.</description>

      <description>Getting started When you first open up a submitted web page, you may be wondering what is different between the submission and the live versions. During user training, encourage your content managers to write descriptions that outline what they&amp;rsquo;ve changed.
Encourage content managers to write a clear subject and message detailing what content has changed.Before you begin reviewing, save a new version of the staged page with a description &amp;ldquo;As submitted by user,&amp;quot;&amp;ndash;this way, you can revert or compare your changes to the original submission.</description>

      <description>By Heidi King, OmniUpdate Guest Post 
It’s no secret that Google is the world’s largest search engine, but few people realize that YouTube is in second place. Consider these statistics:
  About 1.3 billion people use the platform.
  YouTube is bigger than Bing, Yahoo!, Ask, and AOL combined.
  The site gets over 30 million visitors daily.
  YouTube on mobile reaches more 18–49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.</description>

      <title>OU Campus Components vs. Snippets</title>
      <link>https://www.satinflame.com/blog/2019/07/oucampus-components-vs-snippets/</link>

      <description>For years, managing advanced features within OU Campus has been handled using a variety of snippets and assets. As a reminder, snippets come in two versions: 1) an inserted chunk of code or text that will be manually edited and managed and 2) table-transformations, which will be the majority of the examples for this article. Assets, similarly, can be used to manage a chunk of code, text, form, or collection of photos within a page; however, since each asset is centrally updated, every instance of one asset points to one source.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Access to your Google Analytics Account</title>
      <link>https://www.satinflame.com/blog/2019/05/regain-access-google-analytics/</link>

      <description>If your site has a mysterious secondary Google Analytics number added to your website&amp;rsquo;s source code or you can&amp;rsquo;t find anyone at your school who seems to know the information for your Google Analytics setup, you may think that the existing information is now lost forever. However, there is one last measure you can try before giving up hope and creating a new Google Analytics account. First, be sure you can login to Google Analytics with the email you choose before requesting your email be added to the account in the following steps.</description>

      <description>In January 2018, Shoreline unveiled an updated Identity Guideline which I implemented from the original PDF into an interactive Identity Guidelines webpage. (As an reminder, it is a best practice—as noted by Jakob Nielsen—to use HTML instead of PDF for online presentations.) In addition to structuring the content to be responsive regardless of device, I added hex codes to each color block and made them clickable so a user could easily copy the color codes to their clipboard.</description>

      <title>Adding Bar Graphs using Highcharts in OU Campus</title>
      <link>https://www.satinflame.com/blog/2018/09/bar-graph-highcharts-ou-campus/</link>

      <description>In this example, the HTML table is transformed using the Highcharts library—it is free for non-profits, so go grab a Highcharts Non-commercial license.
On your page, include the Highcharts library file as well as your customized JS—specific to this type of bar graph setup. In your file at /_resources/ou/editor/wysiwyg.css or similar, add the following CSS to show the table in edit mode only:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  #datatable.</description>

      <description>About the Conference OUTC is an annual conference targeted to new and existing users of OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus system. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, OU Campus is a CMS targeted towards higher education that provides a very powerful and extensible platform using XSLT.
It had been four years since I&amp;rsquo;d last attended a national conference, so I had a lot to learn. I was also excited to meet up with those who I had previously worked with during redesign projects and smaller updates.</description>

      <description>Overview This code demo available on GitHub allows you to create a loading progress bar that is managed from a table transformation within OmniUpdate&amp;rsquo;s OU Campus. The CSS and JavaScript must be added into your page either by including it into your global files or making a separate call to each. The jQuery library must be loaded prior to calling the JavaScript code. Developers: If you add on any helpful additions, please make a Pull Request!</description>

      <description>My previous history included years of working as a front-end developer in higher education. It was hard to know what I&amp;rsquo;d get out of a 12-week bootcamp, but with a large amount of experience and self-study under my belt, I was ready to commit to finally getting the full exposure of modern web development. With 11 weeks behind me and only one week left, I wanted to share the journey so far.</description>

      <title>Setting Up A Multi Website Magento Store</title>

      <description>Last year I had the opportunity to learn about working in the e-commerce platform Magento–creating products, adding modules, updating security patches and more. Though there is a lot to learn, understanding the file structure of Magento was essential in order to migrate another store (running version 1.4) into a multi-website for another store that had been recently upgraded to 1.9.2. While searching for the best process, I learned there are many ways to set up a second store on the same Magento install—but there were many things I still didn’t understand being the novice server administer of a one-person web team.</description>

      <description>While this entry could also be aptly named OMG How Do I Make Pages Load Faster in Magento?, I’ve finally found a solution to speeding up my Magento website that makes me so much less bitter, I can now even think semi-straight. If you’re searching for answers as well–and perhaps not finding adequate solutions–I hope this post will be of value for learning all the different ways to increase your Magento website’s performance!</description>

      <title>Giant Decline in Bounce Rate: Is it Really a Good Thing?</title>

      <description>Is it Really a Good Thing?
No, probably not.
In April 2016, I updated a website with a fresh, responsive Magento design in collaboration with Social Ruckus in Bozeman, Montana. There was a noticeable slowing of the websites as most features used AJAX and dynamic loading. Even so, I noticed a huge drop (~50% to 3%) in bounce rate.
Bounce dropped after releasing RWD--I&#39;m a bit nervous. What other metrics should I look at?</description>

      <description>In 2015, I had the pleasure of implementing a university lead generation form designed by Graphic Designer Ron Lambert and the Montana State University marketing team!
Overall this design was challenging due to a few of our special page requirements:
Keep the users on the lead page In order to get the contact information we hoped for, we had to include enough content to remain informative without linking to other pages.</description>

      <description>When looking into how best to create an image with interactive elements, I had to go beyond using outdated image maps and get creative with implementing maps using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and creating a responsive, interactive information pop-ups!
This map looks great on desktop and mobile**—**test it out yourself! The functionality enables a user to click either the name or the building itself to learn more about it.
Within Illustrator, we grouped paths and then was able to edit the exported .</description>

Create variation families If you have many items with similar features, be sure your customer can see them all immediately. By using Amazon’s variation form, you can associate your products with one another using up to two variation options. The most common variants include color, style and size.</description>

      <description>Working with the team from OmniUpdate along with Mary Haste from Naropa University, we implemented a redesign for the entire university website.
Unlike other designs I’ve implemented, Naropa University’s wasn’t quite ready to move all pages into the responsive view. We worked through the challenges and created non-responsive and responsive versions using the same Sass-based CSS. As they work through updating each page’s outdated elements—removing fixed width content, updating low-quality images with higher-resolution versions and revisiting text—they can then easily switch their page to the responsive version using a page setting in the OmniUpdate CMS!</description>

      <description>In the summer of 2014, I had the opportunity to develop the code for a design created by the team at I-SITE, INC. for the College of Professional Students in Boston, MA. Unlike new development work, this redesign required an update to the base code using only minimal CSS.
Before updating, this Web page had used mobile queries to (unfortunately) simply hide the “unnecessary” mobile elements to make the content disappear on smaller devices.</description>
